Basic data types:
boolean, float, integer, string, long
lists- mutable and contain arbitrary data []
Tuples-immutable, do not change ()
Dictionary- key, value pairs. {}

Finding an element:
sequential search- search thru the list.
binary search- list separated and reseparated into 2 until it returns true. works for 
                unsorted list.

Conditions and loops:
if- checks the condition, executes for true then stops. Otherwise, it stops.
if... elif-- provides a second conditional branch.
while-- gives room for iteration until a condition is met.
do..while--runs atleast once even if the condition is not satisfied.
