Stack:
Stack is a memory in which values are stored and retrieved in “last in first out”
manner
pop and push== remove and add respectively

Recursive functions:
function that calls itself
slower than loops 
2 parts -Termination Condition and Body.
termination condition- simple with no recursion or function will run continously and consume all stack memory
Three important properties of recursive algorithm are:
 1.    A recursive algorithm must have a termination condition.
 2.    A recursive algorithm must change its state, and move towards the termination
 condition.
 3.    A recursive algorithm must call itself
